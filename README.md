- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Brandon, welcome to my GitHub.  My background is in engineering (masters and PhD in biomedical and bachelors in mechanical) and healthcare.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m most experienced in Python and SQL, but am avidly building on that knowledge to fill out a more full stack profile.  That includes HTML, Javascript, and solidity for new paradigms.  Anything that can make me a more agile individual, full stack developer, and engineer.
- ðŸ“« Ping me on LinkedIn, link is in my profile.
